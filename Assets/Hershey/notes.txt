The format of the files is described as follows:

The structure is bascially as follows: each character consists of a
number 1->4000 (not all used) in column 0:4, the number of vertices in
columns 5:7, the left hand position in column 8, the right hand
position in column 9, and finally the vertices in single character
pairs. All coordinates are given relative to the ascii value of
'R'. If the coordinate value is " R" that indicates a pen up
operation.  As an example consider the 8th symbol

8 9MWOMOV RUMUV ROQUQ
It has 9 coordinate pairs (this includes the left and right position).
The left position is 'M' - 'R' = -5
The right position is 'W' - 'R' = 5
The first coordinate is "OM" = (-3,-5)
The second coordinate is "OV" = (-3,4)
Raise the pen " R"
Move to "UM" = (3,-5)
Draw to "UV" = (3,4)
Raise the pen " R"
Move to "OQ" = (-3,-1)
Draw to "UQ" = (3,-1)
Drawing this out on a piece of paper will reveal it represents an 'H'.
